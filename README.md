This reposity is for the firebaseprep

## Getting Started
1. Clone to your workspace.
2. Open in visual studio code or whatever terminal your using
3. Run these commands in the following order in the terminal
```node
npm install
ionic cordova prepare
```
4. Run one of these commands to test locally in your browser. Some plugins may not work because of beening run in browser not on actual device.
```node
ionic serve
ionic lab
```

## Basic Usage
1. Enviornment Variables 
I added the ability to have different setting depending on if we want to build for local, dev, prod. The setting exist in src/environments should be easy to tell which files are for which environments. To build for the different enviornments use these commands. Look at package.json for more details on these or to modify them
 ```node
 //builds for android
npm run cordova:build:android 
npm run cordova:build:android:dev
npm run cordova:build:android:prod
 //run on android
npm run cordova:run:android 
npm run cordova:run:android:dev
npm run cordova:run:android:prod
//builds for ios
npm run cordova:build:ios
npm run cordova:build:ios:dev
npm run cordova:build:ios:prod
//builds run ios
npm run cordova:run:ios
npm run cordova:run:ios:dev
npm run cordova:run:ios:prod
//Run in browser
ionic serve
npm run ionic:serve:dev
npm run ionic:serve:prod
```

## Prerequisites
1. Make sure node.js is installed (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Once nodejs is installed run the following command in cmd
```node
npm install -g cordova ionic
```
3. Install visual studio code (or some other editor) (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
4. For android use make sure to install Android studio (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) make sure it exists on your main drive because you will need command line functions to work properly. (at least in my experience i needed to do that)

## Potential Errors
1. If when you build you get an error about promise-polyfill run the following command
```node
npm install promise-polyfill --save-exact
```
